Security Requirements
---------------------

* For any blog, program and data of other blogs should not be readable.
* No program can exhaust the server by taking too much resources.
* No program can do hacking on other blogs or servers.

Customize PHP Engine
--------------------

We have customized a PHP Engine for USTC Blog:

* PhpSandbox? -- Make database connected as soon as the PHP program starts running, so it is unnecessary and impossible for PHP code to connect database.
* PhpCore -- Make it impossible for PHP programs to write any PHP file in code directory, and refuses to execute any PHP program in data directory. Hence a file is either writable or executable, but never both.
* PhpDaemon -- Disable native networking functions. Only simple HTTP GET and POST can be performed by requesting daemon.
* PhpSandbox? -- Automatically send access log to daemon after each request terminates.
* PhpBlog? -- App info is saved in admin database and the functions are implemented in PHP extension.
